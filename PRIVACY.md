Clément Blanco built the "Downloads" as an Open Source Chrome Extension. This SERVICE is provided by Clément Blanco at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Downloads unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

The extension does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

**Chrome Permissions**

This Service will use the following permissions from your Chrome Browser:

* [`chrome.downloads`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/downloads) programmatically initiate, monitor, manipulate, and search for downloads.

It is only used to count the number of active downloads.

**Cookies**

This Service does not use any “cookie” explicitly.

**Service Providers**

This Service does not use any “service provider” explicitly.

**Security**

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service does not contain links to other sites.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
